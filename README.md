Web-Based Pneumonia Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
The web-based pneumonia detection system is an innovative healthcare application designed to assist medical professionals in the early detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this system provides an efficient and accurate method for diagnosing pneumonia, potentially improving patient outcomes through early intervention.

Functionality
User Interface: The web application offers a user-friendly interface where healthcare providers can upload chest X-ray images for analysis.
Image Preprocessing: Uploaded images undergo preprocessing steps such as normalization, resizing, and enhancement to ensure optimal input quality for the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, fine-tuned on a large dataset of labelled chest X-ray images, is employed to detect features indicative of pneumonia.
Prediction and Analysis: The system processes the input image through the model, which then outputs a probability score indicating the presence of pneumonia. The result is displayed along with a heatmap overlay on the X-ray image, highlighting areas of concern.
Report Generation: The system generates a detailed report summarizing the analysis, including the prediction score, heatmap visualization, and any additional notes. This report can be downloaded or printed for further review.
Data Storage and Management: Patient data and X-ray images are securely stored, allowing healthcare providers to manage patient records and track diagnostic history.
High-Level Architecture

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
Backend: Developed with Python and Flask/Django, handling image uploads, preprocessing, and interaction with the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model: A CNN model implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, trained on a dataset such as the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset.
Database: A secure database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing patient records and analysis results.
Cloud Storage: Utilized for scalable and secure storage of chest X-ray images (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
APIs: RESTful APIs facilitate communication between the frontend and backend components, ensuring seamless data flow and integration.
