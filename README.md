 PLAN OF IMPLEMNTATION
Gathering and preprocessing data 
 All transformations performed on raw data prior to feeding it to the machine learning
algorithm is refered to as pre-processing. Technically data preprocessing is a technique in
which the main aim is to transform the data into that form which is compatile for the model to
understand before data can be used, it must be preprocessed.
Training the model with different algorithms
 In this proposed model, firstly the dataset is imported and split into three parts train,
test and validation. Now each train, test and validation set is been initialized. After that now
this set will be need to transform into proper form of images using ImageDataGenerator. The
ImageDataGenerator will automatically label all the data inside folder as pneumonia which
images are of positive patients and vis-a-vis for negative patients. By this function the model
is the stage that the object of the class ImageDataGenerator is been created now for creating
data-frames of train-data, pass each train-data to data-frame attribute in the function which
will convert the images into array. So now as the data frame has been generated that will be
passed into the model training. Convolutional neural networks are algorithms that detect
patterns in data. In general, neural networks are composed of layers of neurons, each with its
own set of learnable weights and biases. 
Testing and evaluating model using F1 score as metric 
 The model is being tested on the test dataset after the completion of the training phase.
Their performance were validated using the accuracy, recall, precision, F1, and area under the
curve (AUC) score. The performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score. Because it helps us understand the strengths and limitations of these model when
making predictions in new situations, model performance is essential for machine learning.
Building frontend of the model
 Frontend of the model is designed using HTML for giving eye cathing look, CSS is
cacading style sheet it gives designer look to html, PHP which is widely used general
scripting language, SQL (structure query language). 
 
Work on backend by implementing login module as security 
 In programming, a useful necessity characterizes an element of a product framework or
its part. A capacity is portrayed as a bunch of data sources, the conduct, and yields. Utilitarian
prerequisites might be counts, specialized subtleties, information control and preparing and
other explicit usefulness that characterize what a framework should achieve. Social
necessities depicting all the situations where the framework utilizes the useful prerequisites
are caught being used cases. If a new user, then register by giving personal details like name,
age, address, phone number, email and pssword.
Deploying the model 
 Deploying the model into an existing production environment to make practical business
decissions based on data. In order to start using a model for practical decision-making, it need
to be effictively deployed into production.
Testing the model
 Selenium is an open-source tool primarily used for automating tasks in web browser.
Selenium testing has become crucial in the web development profession. It is also possible to
perform multiple tests with selenium.
TOOLS/TECHNOLOGIES USED
• Python
 Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with
dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and
dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for
use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple,
easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity
and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in
source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data
analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted
by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks,
like organizing finances.
• Jupyter notebook
 The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create
and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter
Notebook is maintained by the people at project jupyter. It is the latest web-based interactive
development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to
configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational
journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich
functionality.A notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines
visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. In other words:
it’s a single document where you can run code, display the output, and also add explanations,
formulas, charts, and make your work more transparent, understandable, repeatable, and
shareable.
• OpenCV
 OpenCV is a cross-stage library which is utilized to grow ongoing pc vision
applications. OpenCV centers principally around picture preparing video cathch and
investigation which incoporates highlights likeface identification and item location.
 Computer vision is one of these fields that explains the procedure to reconstruct,
interrupt, and understand a 3D scene from its 2D images, based on the properties of the
structure present in the image. Computer vision deals with replicating the human vision using
hardware and software technologies. There are many such field with which computer vision
overlaps such as image processing, pattern recognition and photogrammetric.
• Tenserflow
 TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale
machine learning. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep
learningmodels and algorithms (aka neural network) and makes them useful by way of
common programmatic metaphors. It uses Python or JavaScript to provide a convenient
front-end API for building applications, while executing those applications in high-
performance C++.TensorFlow was developed by the google brain team for internal google
use in research and production.
• Keras
 Keras is one of the most powerful and easy to use python library, which is built on
top of popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, Theano, etc., for creating deep
learning models.Keras runs on top of open source machine libraries like TensorFlow, Theano
or Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). Keras was created to be user friendly, modular, easy to extend,
and to work with Python. The API was “designed for human beings, not machines,” and
“follows best practices for reducing cognitive load.”
• HTML
 HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark-up language which is used for creating web
pages and web pages and web application. Let’s see what is meant by hypertext mark-up
language, and web page. Hyper text: Hypertext simply means “Text within Text.” A text has
a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new
webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. Hypertext is a way to link two or more web page
(HTML document) with each other.
 Mark-up language: A mark-up language is a computer language that is used to apply
layout and formating conventions to a text document. Mark-up language makes text more
interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc. Web page: A web
page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A
web page can be identified by entering an URL. A web page can be of the static or dynamic
type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
• CSS
 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should
be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. It is generally used with
HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind
of XML document including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is used along with HTML and
javascript in most website to create user interface for web applications and user interface for
many mobile applications. Before CSS, tags like font, colour, background style, element
alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long
process.
• Javascript 
 JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is
used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged
programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an
HTML document.With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact
directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide
several forms of interactivity and simplicity.The traditional website uses js to provide several
form of interactively and simplicity.
• PHP
 The PHP Hypertext preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web
developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for
developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with
PHP. It is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage
dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is
integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. PHP use for control statements, functions,
array, string, file handling, form handling, regular expression, date and time, object-oriented
programming in PHP, math, PHP MySQL, PHP with Ajax, PHP with jQuery and PHP with
XML.
 PHP is an open-source, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language that can be
executed at the server-side. PHP is well suited for web development. Therefore, it is used to
develop web applications (an application that executes on the server and generates the
dynamic page.)
